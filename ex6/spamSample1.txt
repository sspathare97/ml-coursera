Now that you've trained the spam classifier, you can use it on your own
emails! In the starter code, we have included spamSample1.txt,
spamSample2.txt, emailSample1.txt and emailSample2.txt as examples. 
The following code reads in one of these emails and then uses your 
learned SVM classifier to determine whether the email is Spam or 
Not Spam
